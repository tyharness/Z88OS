Hello All,

I'd just like thank Prof. Frank Rieg. for developing z88 over many years.  I first used z88 version 10 for windows 25 plus years ago
when I was a student. I had a short course using ANSYS 5.0 on the VAX but I learnt a great deal from z88 at home.  
You couldn't get the time on the VAX.

For educational purposes I'd like to compile the source for Raspberry PI 3.  I don't fancy trying to port the later 
gui versions but I think v15 I can do, and hopefully all you young shaver's will have as much fun (or frustration) 
learning finite element analysis plus a touch of ANSI C thrown in for good measure.

Here's an old tutorial I created for v10 or v12 some years ago, but the v15 input files need a little tweeking.

<a href="http://www.tyharness.dx.am/z88/bp5/bp5.htm"> Example bp5 by Ty Harness </a>

I've teaked it and the example does runs in v15.  It's in the directory examples/tyharness1/bp5_v15/

I've tweaked the makefiles and they are in /make/raspberrypi/ which compile and pop the binaries into /bin/raspberrypi

I've also compiled the binaries for the Raspberry PI3 and have uploaded /bin/raspberrypi/

As soon as I can I will test and provide more instructions on how to compile and execute z88.

Set your path varible so z88com can execute all the programs - I do this for each session rather than perm.

open a terminal and navigate to:
cd ~/Z88OS-master/bin/raspberrypi

export PATH=$PATH:~/Z88OS-master/bin/raspberrypi

Becareful if you want to set it perm.  Different flavours of linux do it a variety of different ways and it's easy to screw
it all up. https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux

then with the path set type
z88com

to execute the Z88 commander dialog

Hit the choly solver and view the o2 and o3 output file and compare the y deflection with the analytic solution 
in the website above.

Enjoy
